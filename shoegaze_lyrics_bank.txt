

Into the light of mine
Inside I fall
Into the light of mine
It's just a love
Into the soul of mine
In by the bed

Into the soul of mine
His soul
His soul the light of mine
It's all a bibe

Into the light of mine
Inside of me
Here's to the light outside
It's all in pain

I see the soul of you
It's just a life

Into the water of me
Inside your bed

Go kill the ghost of her
Don't bother me

Here's to the light outside
In the water
In the water
In the water



Crazy for lovin' you
Crazy for lovin' you
Crazy for lovin' you
Crazy for lovin' you
Crazy for lovin' you
Crazy for lovin' you
Crazy for lovin' you
Crazy for lovin' you
Crazy for lovin' you
Crazy for lovin' you

Miranda
Miranda, we met face to face and I lost me head
Miranda, I saw your smile and felt something click inside
Miranda, fifteen hours together in Arizona
I couldn't stand up, small talk
And no small amount of beer
Last night turned into today
You were one mile high and rising
Miranda, a party for two in your hotel room
I couldn't stand it
The fun came easily, but the next day too soon
Last night turned into today
You were one mile high and rising
My mind is swimming, the bells are ringing in my ears
The sun's peaking through the curtains
Seeing you all too clear
A wink and a smile and a kiss good-bye
A wink and a smile and a kiss good-bye
A wink and a smile and a kiss good-bye
A wink and a smile and a kiss good-bye
Good-bye, so long, I hope that I will see you around
Good-bye, so long, I hope that I will see you around
Good-bye, so long, I hope that I will see you around
Good-bye, so long, I hope that I will see you around

Instrumental



Sits down by the fire
Ease his worried mind
If only I could try
Reach the light inside

Feels so hard to say
Chase his fears away
Know that I won't try
Catch his dreams today



This whole life
Is all of us
This whole dream
Is all of me

Minnow lies
Inside me now
No one here
Is sure

He is all of us
He is all of us
He is all of us
He is all of us

He looks centuries older
He's of centuries gone
Recognise i need her
I can hold you close

He is all of us
He is all of us
He is all of us
He is all of us



[Verse 1]
Listen close and don't be stoned
I'll be here in the morning cause I'm just floating
Your cigarette still burns
Your messed-up world will thrill me

[Chorus 1]
Alison, I'm lost
"Alison," I said, "We're sinking"
There's nothing here but that's okay
Outside your room, your sister's spinning
But she lies, tells me she's just fine
I guess she's out there somewhere

[Verse 2]
And the sailors, they strike poses
TV covered walls end so slowly
With your talking and your pills
Your messed-up life still thrills me

[Chorus 2]
Alison, I'm lost
Alison, I'll drink your wine
I wear your clothes when we're both high
"Alison," I said, "We're sinking"
But she laughs and tells me it's just fine
I guess she's out there somewhere



[Verse]
See you walking and
I know she's my friend
Again
Just the weight of the water
Drags me down
Again
Guess I'll think of the water
It's my friend
Oh yeah
It's just the way that the water
Makes me feel
Again

[Chorus]
Son of Sheba
I saw him drown
Son of yellow
I saw him down
It's all I need yeah

[Verse]
See you walking and
I know she's my friend
Again
Just the weight of the water
Drags me down

It's just the way that the water
Makes me feel
Again

[Chorus]
Son of Sheba
I saw him drown
Son of yellow
I saw him down
It's all I need yeah



Forty days and I miss you
I'm so high that I've lost my mind
It's the summer I'm thinking of
Forty days and I'm blown away

If I saw something new
I guess I wouldn't worry
If I saw something new
I guess I wouldn't care

You said you're always sleeping
But if so, I'll be leaving
It's just that I'm always falling
And it makes me feel bad, yeah

If I saw something new
I guess I wouldn't worry
If I saw something new
I guess I wouldn't care

Just to try and watch you
Said I love the way that you smile
(I don't know)

Makes me try and watch you
I said I love the way that you smile
(I don't know)

Smile whenever I watch you
I said I love the way that you smile
(I don't know)

Smile whenever I watch you
I said I love the way that you smile
(I don't know)



Sing where the other boys can watch you dance
Here come my man

Sing where the other boys can watch you dance
Here in my mind

Watch you fall away
I know

Sing where the other boys can watch you dance
See you cover death
I know

We're fine, you are blind
Caught it from behind
Feel you fall away

It's so lonely in this place
So cold I don't believe
And as no-one knows my name

It's easy to pretend
It's easy to believe

There's a shadow on my wall
It dances like my soul
Dances like my soul

It's so cold now
I swear it will be warm
Here she come now



Closed doors
Brings open minds
(and I don't want to see you)

See you smile
Inside
(and I don't want to know you)

Faces
And I've fallen
(and I don't want to hear you)

Wonder why I'm here now
In asylum, don't you see?
In asylum don't you see

Doors close
And feelings flow
(and I don't want to know you)

Through my mind
I feel his...
(and I don't want to hear you)

Pictures
And i've fallen
(and I don't wanna know you)

Wonder why

Curse your soul
I don't wanna know you

(and I) Curse your soul
I don't wanna know you...

Burn so fast it scares me
Mind games don't leave me

As the sun hits, she'll be waiting
With her coffins under heaven
Hey hey lover you still burn me
You're a song yeah, hey hey

Sweet thing, I watch you
Burn so fast it scares me
Mind games don't lose me

Sitting by and watch you fall away
Sudden fall, watched you for a day
You know I don't believe in death
Follow the sun, watch you flow

Sitting here and watch the death
Looking for the sun and watch the death

[Chorus]
So long, so long
It's just a way to love you
So long, so long
It's just a way to love you

I saw you looking at the sun

[Chorus x5]
So long, so long
It's just a way to love you



The sunshine girl is sleeping
She falls and dreams alone
And me I am her dagger
Too numb to feel her pain

The world is full of noise yeah
I hear it all the time
And me I am your dagger
You know I am your wound

I thought I heard you whisper
It happens all the time
I thought I heard you whisper
It happens all the time

She whispers while I'm sleeping:
"I love you when you smile"
I didn't really lose you
I just lost it for a while

The world is full of noise yeah
I hear it all the time
You know I am your dagger
You know I am your wound

I thought I heard you whisper
It happens all the time
I thought I heard you whisper

It's alright, we're altogether

Yeah, yeah

It's alright, we're altogether

Yeah, yeah



Screams that seem unreal
Shouts follow the sins
There's nothing here for me now
The wind blows for as far as I can see

I long for the sun
The midland air
For all that I have
There's written in waves
I know that now
There's left to be seen
I know that I've lost him
I'm leaving here

Fastest knife a sign
Feels so far away
There's nothing here for me now
The clouds fly, so far
I'm lost there now

I long for the sun
The midland air
For all that I have
Is written in waves
And now that I know
Is left to be seen
And now that I've lost him
I'm leaving here



Feels like all the days are gone
Just catch the breeze
You know you've had your fun
Rain washes waves down

And i, i want the world to cry
And i, i watch the winds you fly
You can believe in everything
You can believe it all

Hey are you feeling something new
Just watch the rain
It helps in all you do
The breeze it blows
It blows everything

And i, i want the world to cry
And i, i want the sun to shine
You can believe in everything
You can believe it all



You tell me I'm lost and I don't seem too sure what to do
You tell me I'm lost and I don't seem too sure what to do
There's a fire in my head and I'm blinded by bullets
There's a fire in my head and I'm blinded by bullets
Dancing to nowhere, I'm losing my head and I'm
Dancing to nowhere, I'm losing my head and I'm
And the man at the bar that night recall that he needed me
And the man at the bar that night recall that he needed me

Sister, I've lost all the feeling
I'm lost and I'm sold
I lay down beside you
Sister, I'm blinded
It's only my eyes
I've sold them before

The man said "The drinking is handled by pouring it right."
The man said "The drinking is handled by pouring it right."
And it seemed much the same when he pointed the gun at his head
And it seemed much the same when he pointed the gun at his head
"Who'd need me then?"
It raised so much noise that I checked out of time, yeah
Blood on my face and the words of a stranger (It raised so much noise and I checked out of time, yeah)

Sister, I've lost all the feeling
I'm lost and I'm sold
I lay down beside you
Sister, I'm blinded
It's only my eyes
I've sold them before



Watch the waves so far away
They're washing cross the paths that i have made

Leaving all my sins i turn away
Like soaring birds i watch my sorrows play

Don't you know
I've left and gone away
You're knocking on the door i closed today
And everything looks brighter
The waves they just soothe my pain away

It felt so good to see the sun
I'll choose my time before i choose the one

Floating cross the waves the silence runs
My thoughts can go but now my sorrows done

(repeat chorus)



She don't understand you
Her birth made of grain
She can now see the sun
And everyone said, yeah
You're better off dead but
She didn't know we were alone
And when it all looks brighter
Just turn around and smile
When it's looking better
Just leave it all to time

She said don't you know, yeah
There's people in places

Screams that seem unreal
Shouts follow the sins
There's nothing here for me now
The wind blows for as far as I can see

I long for the sun
The midland air
For all that I have
There's written in waves
I know that now
There's left to be seen
I know that I've lost him
I'm leaving here

Fastest knife a sign
Feels so far away
There's nothing here for me now
The clouds fly, so far
I'm lost there now

I long for the sun
The midland air
For all that I have
Is written in waves
And now that I know
Is left to be seen

Please me, make me happy
Breather, sleeper
Make me happy

Misty, crystal
Blister, eternal

Soft and liquid in the light
Secret otherworldly sight
Passing time in black and white
If only i could dream tonight
On my own
Teenage lessons set me right
Taught me how to dream tonight

Love me warm in cold daylight
Soft as skin and safe inside
Smother silky sin so fine
Make believe that you are mine
On my own
Tears and sorrow set me right
Taught me how to dream tonight



Sink deeper, autosleeper
Swallow the ache in my skull
Sweet pleasure of never heaven
Soak me in soul-shifting light

Blind angel move through me
Dangerous, vacuous bliss
Move through me

Come closer, autosleeper
Daze all the thoughts from my brain
Slow slumber, pull me under
Bathe me in nothingness truth



Treasure
Feel it in me
Don't speak
Smothered jewel
Dazzle
Shadow
Blind me

Just for you
I'm in heaven
Oh, I'm in hell
You are in heaven
Oh, I'm in hell

Treasure
Wasted
Twisted
Drifting
I know
I see
Treasure
In me

Treasure
Feel it in me
Don't speak



Falling down
Leads me where I wanna go
Higher now
Leave me I don't wanna know

Falling down, I'm on my own now
Don't tell me it's time to go
Time to reach out to the side
Time to take me for a ride
Suffocate me gently baby
Drown me in your velvet snow

Falling down
Lead me to a sacred low
Higher now
Tell me what I wanna know

Soft and blushing pale in secrets
Breathe on me those words we love
Silent joy I'm thinking of
Take me to a world above
Falling down I'm on my own now
Sinking in a reeling girl



Days bathed in red
I saw her standing
By the riverbed
Weeping willow

I should have been more careful
Waxing hope in cruelest April
I thought that we were there
Somehow i'll always love her
Shedding, golden leaved September
I thought that we were there

Dazed, she never smiles
Like she used to
All the while
Weeping willow



Silent sin of endless sleeping
Wakes to find your conscience weeping
Shame
Time recalls the distant voices
Ancient memories leave no choice

Tormenting guilt like wreaths of hatred
Different skin of different places
Pain
Feed their sweat and taste their breath
Deceive yourself 'til nothing's left



If you want me i can follow
I can follow you
And if you need me
To stand by you
I will see it through
Take me softly in your arms
Until we say goodbye
Let me be your guiding light
And never have to question why

River of your dreams
Drift on gently by
Bring me to the water's edge
And bathe me flowing stream
Come with me today
'Cos I'm asking you to stay
Or drift on by

Baby, if you want me



Crystal light in deep blue eyes
Weren't enough to satisfy
Senses reeling off the floor
But i always wanted something more
You're not alone

Had to tell you how i felt
Had to try with someone else
Breathless nights or burning sun
Waking tears, you weren't the one
You're not alone

Pick me off the floor



Why tie a ribbon in her hair?
She knows that he don't even care
Please help her find a way to a better place
Hurt is the way he makes her feel
Pain doesn't seem to be for real

Caroline your time is near
Caroline must wait in here

Lies alone inside her room
Now she knows that she's the fool
Please let her find a way to a better place
Chose to live with too much pain
Sixteen years of life go straight away



Believe in me, I can see what you do
The senseless thoughts are hiding what I see in you
Unquestioned doubt is eluding me
Show me something real that only I can see

Come on closer to my maiden flesh
Make me feel it in my bones
Caress the softness of my breathing frame
Invade my beauty with your love

Deceive in me, I see the fear in you
Keep inside the part of you that's true
Satin safe from reality
Satin safe, but satin safe from me

Suck the living death out of me
Devour the being of my soul
Claw my back and let the feeling flow
Peel my skin and let it show

Endless scenes are passing over me
Worthless time of drifting days
Sugar friendly lay beside of me
Take this emptiness away



Well, it's like something's in the air
That makes me feel the same
Always racing to the near side

Crazed illusion crashing through
Brave the sea of rage
Always wishing, always wasting

Torn between the passing times
The end escapes me
Sadness maims the only recall

Crazed illusion crashing through
Brave the sea of rage
Always wishing, always wasting



Beneath your skin... I'm swimming
In your eyes... I'm drowning
Days speed by... sleeping
Distant times come nearer and go

Into the sky... soaring
Come to me... heaven
Climbing high... melting
Distant times come nearer and go



The winter days are closing again
They bring a chill into my heart
Morning frost surrounds your hazel eyes
As gentle ivy clings to bark

Angel, penetrate my heart
Angel, take you in my arms

Restless nights of dreaming endlessly
Fever burns me to the core
Your kind of torment creeps on up to me
As the sea breeze slides onto the shore



[Verse 1]
Sleep like a pillow downward and
Where she won't care anywhere
Soft as a pillow touch her there
Where she won't dare somewhere

[Verse 2]
Sleep like a royal subject and
Think that you grew stronger
Speak your troubles, she's not scared
Soft like there's silk everywhere

[Verse 3]
Sleep as a pillow, comfort there
Where she won't dare anywhere
Look in the mirror, she's not there
Where she won't care somewhere



[Verse 1]
Tiptoe down to the holy places
Where you going now, don't turn around
Little girls in their party dresses
Didn't like anything there

[Verse 2]
Pretty boys with their sunshine faces
Carrying their heads down
Tiptoe down to the lonely places
Where you going now, don't turn around



[Instrumental]



[Verse 1]
Kiss, your fear
Your red button falls from my mouth
Slip, your dress
Over your head, it’s been so long

[Hook]
Come(?)

[Verse 2]
Move, on top
Because that way you touch her too
Turn, your head
Come back again to here knows when

[Hook]
Come(?)



[Chorus]
When I look at you
Oh, I don't know what's real
Once in a while
And you make me laugh
And I'll see you tomorrow
And it won't be long
Once in a while
Then you take me down
Then you walk away

[Verse]
When you say "I do"
Oh, I don't believe you
I can't forget it, ooh
When you sleep tomorrow
And it won't be long
Once in a while
When you make me smile
And you turn your long blonde hair

[Chorus]
When I look at you
Oh, I don’t know what’s real
Once in a while
And you make me laugh
And I’ll see you tomorrow
And it won’t be long
Once in a while
Then you take me down
Then you walk away



[Verse 1]
See there run away you said
To go you were it, you were it
To lay underneath the red sky there
To lay under her, I want her there

[Verse 2]
See you there, under her, and under
To go you were there and I'm slow
To lay over her and I'm slow, oh
To lay under her, I've grown away, oh



[Verse 1]
Come in alone, you will love to let go
And I'll turn you around
When your hopes gave me doubts
(Ohh)
Run and hide
Why I don't need to believe
What you see to look up and around
You were gone, words came out to a sound

[Verse 2]
Feel, I'm alive
You will see why I'm alive
Felt like crying over her
I will go to the wall
(Ohh)
Run from some
Come in alone, you will love to let go
And I'll turn you around
When your hopes gave me doubts
(Ohh)
Run and hide



[Verse 1]
Close my eyes, feel me now
I don't know how you could not love me now
You will know, with her feet down to the ground
Over there, and I want true love to love
You can't hide, oh no, from the way I feel

[Verse 2]
Turn my head into sound
I don't know when I lay down on the ground
You will find the way it hurts to love
Never cared, and the world turned hearts to love
You will see, oh now, oh the way I do

[Verse 3]
You will wait, see me go
I don't care, when your head turned all alone
You will wait, when I turn my eyes around
Overhead, when I hold you next to me
Overhead, to know, oh the way I see

[Verse 4]
Close my eyes, feel me how
I don't know, maybe you could not hurt me now
Here alone, when I feel down too
Over there, when I await true love for you
You can hide, oh now, the way I do
You can see, oh now, oh the way I do



[Verse 1]
Midnight wish blow me a kiss
I'll blow one to you
Make like this
Try to pretend it's true
Show me all your favorite things
Show you all mine too
Make a wish
I'll give it all to you

[Verse 2]
Hold on to your promises
Hold on to mine too
Caught like this
I'll turn it in with you
Fall apart my beating heart
Nothing left to do
Once in love
I'll be the death of you



[Verse 1]
What I do I say but I can't get far away
Oh, I go back to a memory again
What you want but you know that I'm alive
Then I'll go back to you don't you know feel inside

[Chorus]
When you come down blue
But I do, I do, I do oh
I come back to the one who calls my name out
What you want don't you know that I can smile
Then I go back to you and then you make him go inside

[Inaudiable]

[Verse 2]
Turn around and smile
No they can't see through your eye
Could I fall into come back down my mind
Then it surrounds you don't you know that I have

[Incomprehensible]

[Chorus]
When you come down blue
But I do, I do, I do oh
I come back to the one who calls my name out
What you want let me know that I'm alive
Then I go back to you and then you make him go inside



[Verse 1]
Wake up, don't fear
I want to love you
Yeah (doll of pain)
I let you get to me
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Come back, don't be
Afraid of me soon
That (I'll harm you)
Your eyes are blue
Blue jewels
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Come back, have faith
Someone like you
Can find the reason
Of what I did to you
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Wake up, don't fear
I want to love you
Yeah (doll of pain)
I let you get to me
Yeah, yeah



[Verse 1]
Sleep like a pillow downward and
Where she won't care anywhere
Soft as a pillow touch her there
Where she won't dare somewhere

Sleep like a royal subject and
Think that you grew stronger
Speak your troubles, she's not scared
Soft like there's silk everywhere

[Verse 3]
Sleep as a pillow, comfort there
Where she won't dare anywhere
Look in the mirror, she's not there
Where she won't care somewhere



[Verse 1]
Tiptoe down to the holy places
Where you going now, don't turn around
Little girls in their party dresses
Didn't like anything there

[Verse 2]
Pretty boys with their sunshine faces
Carrying their heads down
Tiptoe down to the lonely places
Where you going now, don't turn around



[Instrumental]



[Verse 1]
Kiss, your fear
Your red button falls from my mouth
Slip, your dress
Over your head, it’s been so long

[Hook]
Come(?)

[Verse 2]
Move, on top
Because that way you touch her too
Turn, your head
Come back again to here knows when

[Hook]
Come(?)



[Chorus]
When I look at you
Oh, I don't know what's real
Once in a while
And you make me laugh
And I'll see you tomorrow
And it won't be long
Once in a while
Then you take me down
Then you walk away

[Verse]
When you say "I do"
Oh, I don't believe you
I can't forget it, ooh
When you sleep tomorrow
And it won't be long
Once in a while
When you make me smile
And you turn your long blonde hair

[Chorus]
When I look at you
Oh, I don’t know what’s real
Once in a while
And you make me laugh
And I’ll see you tomorrow
And it won’t be long
Once in a while
Then you take me down
Then you walk away



[Verse 1]
See there run away you said
To go you were it, you were it
To lay underneath the red sky there
To lay under her, I want her there

[Verse 2]
See you there, under her, and under
To go you were there and I'm slow
To lay over her and I'm slow, oh
To lay under her, I've grown away, oh



[Verse 1]
Come in alone, you will love to let go
And I'll turn you around
When your hopes gave me doubts
(Ohh)
Run and hide
Why I don't need to believe
What you see to look up and around
You were gone, words came out to a sound

[Verse 2]
Feel, I'm alive
You will see why I'm alive
Felt like crying over her
I will go to the wall
(Ohh)
Run from some
Come in alone, you will love to let go
And I'll turn you around
When your hopes gave me doubts
(Ohh)
Run and hide



[Verse 1]
Close my eyes, feel me now
I don't know how you could not love me now
You will know, with her feet down to the ground
Over there, and I want true love to love
You can't hide, oh no, from the way I feel

[Verse 2]
Turn my head into sound
I don't know when I lay down on the ground
You will find the way it hurts to love
Never cared, and the world turned hearts to love
You will see, oh now, oh the way I do

[Verse 3]
You will wait, see me go
I don't care, when your head turned all alone
You will wait, when I turn my eyes around
Overhead, when I hold you next to me
Overhead, to know, oh the way I see

[Verse 4]
Close my eyes, feel me how
I don't know, maybe you could not hurt me now
Here alone, when I feel down too
Over there, when I await true love for you
You can hide, oh now, the way I do
You can see, oh now, oh the way I do



[Verse 1]
Midnight wish blow me a kiss
I'll blow one to you
Make like this
Try to pretend it's true
Show me all your favorite things
Show you all mine too
Make a wish
I'll give it all to you

[Verse 2]
Hold on to your promises
Hold on to mine too
Caught like this
I'll turn it in with you
Fall apart my beating heart
Nothing left to do
Once in love
I'll be the death of you



[Verse 1]
What I do I say but I can't get far away
Oh, I go back to a memory again
What you want but you know that I'm alive
Then I'll go back to you don't you know feel inside

[Chorus]
When you come down blue
But I do, I do, I do oh
I come back to the one who calls my name out
What you want don't you know that I can smile
Then I go back to you and then you make him go inside

[Inaudiable]

[Verse 2]
Turn around and smile
No they can't see through your eye
Could I fall into come back down my mind
Then it surrounds you don't you know that I have

[Incomprehensible]

[Chorus]
When you come down blue
But I do, I do, I do oh
I come back to the one who calls my name out
What you want let me know that I'm alive
Then I go back to you and then you make him go inside



[Verse 1]
Wake up, don't fear
I want to love you
Yeah (doll of pain)
I let you get to me
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Come back, don't be
Afraid of me soon
That (I'll harm you)
Your eyes are blue
Blue jewels
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Come back, have faith
Someone like you
Can find the reason
Of what I did to you
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Wake up, don't fear
I want to love you
Yeah (doll of pain)
I let you get to me
Yeah, yeah



[Verse 1]
Keep coming now
Possessed of nothing more than Hell
Before I can speak
My world is wishing me asleep

[Hook]
Ooooooh, ooooooh
Ooooooh, ooooooh

[Verse 2]
Weigh me down
And when the darkness comes around
Repeating heads
Remember nothing I have said

[Hook]
Ooooooh, ooooooh
Ooooooh, ooooooh
Ooooooh, ooooooh
Ooooooh, ooooooh

[Verse 3]
Where are you
Come back again, I want you to
'Not now girl' you say
But I was born to lose my breath

[Hook]
Ooooooh, ooooooh
Ooooooh, ooooooh
Ooooooh, ooooooh
Ooooooh, ooooooh



[Chorus]
Cupid come from coffee cup
Sickly heavy heart
Semi-set adrift in your
Lifted sugar eye
Come back down I'm waiting here
And lick me with your fire
Connected silver tongues
Our lips beside

[Verse]
Everytime I look at you
Pins me to the ground
Mirror me your memories, please
And let me help you down
Swallow me into your bed
With glimpses of your thighs
Forget your vanity
Come cupid, come

[Chorus]
Cupid come from coffee cup
Sickly heavy heart
Semi-set adrift in your
Lifted sugar eye
Come back down I'm waiting here
And lick me with your fire
Connected silver tongues
Our lips beside



[Verse 1]
They'll have you now
And again
And then again
And again
Left me black and blue

[Hook 1]
No more sorry

[Verse 2]
Pleasureable
Not alone
You're not alone
Waiting by the telephone
Whatever you do

[Hook 2]
Don't call daddy

[Verse 3]
In my hair
Everywhere
Everywhere
And everywhere
Fingerprints of you

[Hook 3]
Filthy daddy

[Verse 4]
Washed and mend
And washed and mend
Some kind of friend
You septic heart, your deadly hand
Left me black and blue

[Hook 1]
No more sorry



[Verse 1]
You don't ask what I needed to do
When I come back you'll need to choose
Oh, whatever I ask you take take take take
Oh, this is all I need to say

[Verse 2]
It's in your eye, I wondered why
No need to say how close can we lie
Oh, we don't talk, you know all I need
Oh, this is what I need to take

[Hook]
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm

[Verse 3]
You don't ask what I needed to do
When I come back you'll need to choose
Oh, all I ask you do do do do
Oh, this is all I need from you

[Hook]
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm



[Verse 1]
Yeah, can you get what you see
But you can't have what you can't
Hey, what's come down over me
It's the way you stood, it's the way you stood

[Chorus]
'Cause things the way they are
I guess you might go real far
So feed me with your kiss

[Verse 2]
Oh, come lie down close to me
Do what you dare, oh I don't care
I will get what I can see I'll crawl over there

[Chorus]
'Cause things the way they are
I guess you might go real far
So feed me with your kiss

[Verse 3]
Spread me like a appeal to you
I do what I do, I do what I will do
Crave, your kiss will set you free
I'll do what I should, I'll do what I should

[Chorus]
'Cause things the way they are
I guess you might go real far
So feed me with your kiss



[Verse 1]
I will don't leave
Me here alone, oh

[Verse 1]
Heard that I met me once before
Was it me or just don't you care
Once more ignore
As I wrap me around we

[Hook 1]
I'm never quite there at all

[Verse 2]
So which me should I put on
To go out driving in my car
Feeling so sore
I took me out dancing

[Hook 2]
Three of me or more

[Chorus]
Insane, I'm sure
We're living inside me
Are several girls galore

[Verse 3]
Once more ignore
I'll wrap me around we

[Hook 1]
I'm never quite there at all

[Chorus]
Insane, I'm sure
We're living inside me
Several girls galore



[Verse 1]
Twisting round inside
My heart is burning up, my head divide
But you control these feelings I can't hide
Tried to change my mind
Until the end there's nothing in control of you
It isn't easy but that's all I can do

[Chorus]
Oh, you took a long time
Yeah, 'cause you probably could
Ooh, you said the fault was mine
Yeah, but you never should

[Verse 2]
Breaking down again
You're running little circles through your hair
I could walk away now and you wouldn't care
Don't look so surprised
You crawl around and then you seem to wonder why
I turn around and see madness in your eyes

[Chorus]
Oh, you took a long time
Yeah, 'cause you probably could
Ooh, you said the fault was mine
Yeah, but you never should



[Verse 1]
Your soft hand
But I don't understand
Your big brown eyes
With a small small heart

[Chorus]
I'll come down, down, down
Oh, you don't know what you found
Don't, don't walk walk walk away

[Verse 2]
Take me
I will remember you
Long dark hair
Nothing much to lose

[Chorus]
Help you crawl crawl crawl
Oh, I want to see it all
Eyes asked why why why, too late

[Verse 3]
Please you
Oh, I know what to do
A soft salt taste
Do you see me as a fool

[Chorus]
Can I look look look
Oh, the things you took
Eyes asked why why why, too late
I'll come down, down, down
Oh, you don't know what you found
Don't, don't walk walk walk away

Keep coming now

My world is wishing me asleep

Johnny likes to get away
Takes himself to sunny Spain
Eyes on the road, look at him go
He's a wide load

Feeling at home on the other side
Feeling the love on the other side
Heart's on fire, he's back in control now
He's back in control now
He's back in control right now

Says he gotta get to Barre
He's picking up some motor car
He's up through the Alps
He'll be doing some laps when he gets there

Love is a truck and an open road
Somewhere to start and a place to go
Heart's on fire, he's back in control now
He's back in control now
He's back in control right now

Heart's on fire, he's back in control now

White lines on the table between us
Caught in the blur between the black and the gray
It's been a hard day for the homecoming queen, yeah
Turn on the lights, you know it's all right, it's all
Right
Yeah, all right

And it's all up between us
Man on a broken raft
Yeah, it's all up between us
Man on a broken raft

White lines on the foreign postcard
Written in jest to the boy with the Vespa
Well, you don't go with the weekend doubles
You know they don't like puzzles like you
Not like you

Is it all up between us?
Felt the sun up between us
And it's all a parade
Lost in dark and daze

Don't go with the weekend doubles
You know they don't like puzzles like you
Not like you
Not like you



Jenny, it's all right
Somebody loves you tonight
Tomorrow we'll make a start
Smoke all them cigarettes

You are the star that sits in the sky
The fire that burns when the battle is high
The feeling that yearns when the yearning is all
In his heart, yeah, in his heart, yeah, in his heart

I know you wanna get away
I know nothing ever stays the same
Jenny, I've been thinking things over
I know thinking never got me far

The bottle gets me further
So come stand a little closer now
We'll try breaking the ice again
We'll try breaking the ice again

You were the first one
You were the first to try
And baby, you stole me
And maybe I needed that

You are the star that sits in the sky
The fire that burns when the battle is high
The feeling that yearns when the yearning is all
In my heart, yeah, in my heart, yeah, in my heart

I know you wanna get away
I know nothing ever stays the same
Jenny, I've been thinking things over

Judy, I can see your colours
Coming out in blue
All your fountains, all your lovers
Are the first to bloom

And you get away
Running at the break of day
Head down, nose to the ground
Running with your eyes closed

Dragonflies and buttercups
Chinese burns and rubber mats
Spring is gone and summer's fleeting
I found the whispers of your leaving
Judy, where's your smile today?

And you get away
Running at the break of day
Head down, nose to the ground
Running with your eyes closed

Judy, I can see your colours
Coming out in blue
All your fountains, all your lovers
Are the first to bloom

And you get away
Running at the break of day
Head down, nose to the ground
Running with your eyes closed

Head down, nose to the ground
Running with your eyes closed, yeah



She was a hummingbird song
She fluttered her wings but she would not come in
And I threw my weight at the door
But she held her ground and she would not come in

And some days I'm better than most
Most days I'm tied to the posts
Was so bad at being bad
Baddest bad boy, that's a fact

She said she was born a traveller
I said I knew as she ran out the door
Our love is like old money
Somewhere out there, somewhere out in the past

She was a hummingbird song
She floated nice but she would not come in
No I would think of her daily
I praise the Lord that I knew her waiting

And most days I'm better than most
Some days I'm tied to the posts
Was so bad at being bad
The baddest bad boy, that's a fact

And some days I'm better than most
Most days I'm tied to the posts
She said she was born a traveller
I said I knew as she ran out the door
I said "I won't let you go"
She said "boy, you know, you're just clutching a straw"

She was a hummingbird song
She fluttered her wings but she would not come in
And I threw my weight at the door
But she held her ground and she would not come in

And most days I'm better than most
Some days I'm tied to the posts
Yeah, most days I'm better than most
Most days I'm tied to the posts



Who's on the right track?
Nobody I know
Baby, it's all smoke and mirrors

See me in bright lights
Maybe you'll be right
But I'm too tired tonight

I don't wanna be the big star, baby, anyway
I don't wanna be the big star, baby, is that okay?
I don't wanna be the big star, baby, anyway

Anyway
Anyway
Anyway
Anyway

Every woman I've ever loved
Has been some kind of fuck-up
But, baby, you're the brightest star of all

Wanna have a good life
Wanna take out out
I wanna leave this road behind

I don't wanna be the big star, baby, anyway
I don't wanna be the big star, baby, is that okay?
I don't wanna be the big star, baby, anyway

Anyway
Anyway
Anyway
Anyway

I don't wanna be the big star, baby, anyway
I don't wanna be the big star, baby, is that okay?
I don't wanna be the big star, baby, anyway

Anyway
Anyway
Anyway
Anyway



You were on the outside waiting
I was on the inside hoping
We jumped in the car to somewhere lonely
Opened our eyes to the sound of the radio

You'll be back and I'll be waiting
Just another ghost ship fading away
Tied to the mast when the girls start
Singing their song

Yeah, the small talk
Makes me feel small
And it's all wrong, it's all wrong
Don't you wanna go home?

Wish I had a fast car waiting
Something sweet to stop my heart complaining
There's a girl running by with a buzz in her eye
Calling me down to the sound of the lights
Calling me back to the sound of the Y

You'll be back and I'll be waiting
Just another ghost ship fading away
Tied to the mast when the girls start
Singing their song

Yeah, the small talk
Makes me feel small
And it's all wrong, it's all wrong
Don't you wanna go home?

You'll be back and I'll be waiting
You'll be back and I'll be waiting
You'll be back and I'll be waiting
You'll be back and I'll be waiting



She's the girl with the long scarf flowing
Corduroy coat and lips so loving
Nights got shorter and her dreams got longer
So strange

Has a bird upon her shoulder
Used to hear it when I got to hold her
I don't know if that bird song died

Kill the lights, 'cause we're getting older
Watch the news and drink more water
She likes a man with his trousers shorter

I'm in trouble with a poet's daughter
Found a hole and it's letting in water
She says love is a young man's game

Close your eyes, we might just make it
Pretty soon you'll be proud to fake it
Drink up, baby, and I'll take you home

Boy at the bus stop shouting
English dreams of English louting
I hope he's happy when the world stops hurting

Paints all the clocks and sleeps for days
Stares at the stars and floats away

Watch the news and drink more water
I'm in trouble with somebody's daughter
She likes a man with his trousers shorter

Paints all the clocks and sleeps for days
Stares at the stars and floats away



Don't it make you feel good
When the world spins another way
And it's all in your head
And every little thing thing she said
Is a call to arms?
A vote for the underclass?yeah, the underdog

Still holding fast

And I don't talk much, no
I don't think much, no
I'm just a boy who hangs around
I keep my eyes clean, yeah
I keep my nose clean, yeah
Just a boy who hangs around

I hear you calling
Don't you know I'm falling?
I keep my back to the world
And Rita takes time to say it's all right

She always had some time to steal

A summer of hate
No holy crusade, and the wars on TV
Are lost on me?yeah, they're lost on you
The battles we fight are all our own
They're shabby and light and stupid and sad
They're all we have

Yeah, they're all we have

And I don't talk much, no
I don't think much, no
I'm just a boy who hangs around
I keep my eyes clean, yeah
I keep my nose clean, yeah
I'm just a boy who hangs around



These are words
A prison curse—I'm sorry
If some hurt

They're thrown with speed, so
Please believe I'm sorry
If some hurt

I am sorry if some hurt

There's my face
And it's the place I live in
It's by the sea

I've eyes of brown
Suns that drown and sink
Without a trace

Yeah, they sink without a trace

Hear the band
Yeah, here they stand and wait
For your applause

Could change this room
With these chords—this tune
In my mouth could form a smile

But loose talk and fears fuel
The mutineers, but I'm
Too old to care

And all that's left
Are words, one breath
I am sorry if some hurt

Yeah, I'm sorry if some hurt

I'm sorry if some hurt
Yeah, I'm sorry if some hurt



Gotta find a way to get home strong
Gotta find a way back home
Gotta find the light to guide me along
Gotta find a a way back home

Running for your life won't get you so far
Running for your life so far
Gotta find the road to bring me home slow
Gotta find a way back home

Gotta find a road that brings me back slow
Gotta find a way back home
The loving in your eye that holds you alive
Gotta find a way back home

Gotta find a way to get home strong
Gotta find a way back home
Gotta find a road that brings me back slow
Gotta find a way back home

Gotta find a way to get home strong
Gotta find a way back home

Saw you turning
Big eyes burning on your way
Nothing out there
The time to tell you what you own

Never wanted to feel this pain
Never wanted to feel so sad
Never wanted to feel this pain
Today, today

Never wanted to feel this pain
Never wanted to feel so sad
Never wanted to feel this pain
Today, today

Never wanted to feel this pain
Never wanted to feel this pain

Gotta find a way to get home strong
Gotta find a way back home
Gotta find a light to guide me along
Gotta find a way back home

Never wanted to feel this pain
Never wanted to feel this pain

Gotta find a road that brings me back slow
Gotta find a way back home
The loving in your eye that holds you alive
Gotta find a way back home

Gotta find a way to get home strong
Gotta find a way back home
Gotta find a road that brings me back slow
Gotta find a way back home

Gotta find a way to get home strong
Gotta find a way back home
Gotta find a way back home
Gotta find a way back home



Writing to St. Peter +-
Said she's writing to St. Peter
‘Cause it didn't haunt her
Be quite slow
To bring an angel to her doll
And help her walk away

Tied in black and white
You're a book that binds
And wraps around
A colour painted on a wall
There's nothing here
That's any brighter

You still watch him driving cars
You thought the world was so much faster
When he held you in his arms
You thought the world was so much nicer

Tied in black and white
You're a book that binds
And wraps around
A colour painted on a wall
There's nothing here
That's any brighter
That's any brighter
That's any brighter

You said lies are always better
Written in a letter
'cause they seem more real
But you know things are so much sadder
When they don't matter
Anyway

Tied in black and white
You're a book that binds
And wraps around
A colour painted on a wall
There's nothing here
That's any brighter
That's any brighter
That's any brighter
That's any brighter



Here’s Rhona
She’s coming back in Style
Battle of the broken hearts, yea-eah
Battle of the broken hearts, yea-eah
Battle of the broken hearts

We broke a lot of things she said
We broke a lot of things she said
We broke a lot of things she said
We broke a lot of things she said

She said
No one wants you when you’re broken
No one needs you when you’re (hurt??)
No one wants you when you’re broken
They can’t love you (inaudible part??)

You can’t love me ’cause I’m broken
You can’t know me while I’m (??)
No one wants you when you’re broken
They can’t love you inside



Wish that I could make you laugh
And make you feel whole again
I cannot lay here on this line

Wish I could see you now
Standing there without a care
I guess, you'd make me smile

It's hard to miss you
It's hard to miss you
It's hard to miss you
It's hard to miss you

It's hard to miss you
It's hard to miss you
It's hard

They say the world's a smaller place
But they don't say it to your face
It's a pretty stupid thing to say

I don't feel it in my space
I don't feel you in my space
I just want to see you in my space

It's hard to miss you
It's hard to miss you
It's hard to miss you
It's hard to miss you

It's hard to miss you
Hard to miss you
It's hard to miss you



Sat down on the beggars bench
Figured it was time I rest
Thought about the things that I would do, yeah
If I just had some money Jack's been here for years
He says that he would like a beer
And I know what he means, yeah
Cos he knows what he needs
He's a man with a plan, oh yeah
A man with a plan, oh yeah
A man with a plan, oh yeah

At quarter to two there's a rush for the shop that sells pastry
Lilly just sits there taking it all in, she's rolling a big one
Cos she don't care
She's thinking about time
Cos she don't mind
Thinking about time

Keep on
Don't let no one break yer heart
Move on
Don't let no one let you down

Keep on
Don't let no one break yer heart
Move on
Don't let no one let you down

Martha said she lost her mantra
In a town that didn't matter
But all that repetition got her down

But if we sit for too long
We might just go wrong
She's thinking it over
She's thinking it over
She's thinking it over

If I had a line I'd be thinking of ways to get with it
But I got nothing just a moment to sing about nothing
Frozen in motion
We're frozen in motion

All dead ends and broken hearts
All dead ends and broken hearts

Keep on
Don't let no one break yer heart
Move on
Don't let no one let you down

Keep on
Don't let no one break yer heart
Move on
Don't let no one let you down

Martha said she lost her mantra
In a town that didn't matter

Martha said she lost her mantra
In a town that didn't matter

Martha said she lost her mantra



Too many mornings you've been gone from my mind
Where you been hiding your state for sore eyes
They took your car, son, yeah rolled it right away
I guess it's somewhere but you're gonna have to pay

It don't take much
Before you lose touch
Yeah you're all right
You lose it all, you bring it back again
You bring it back again

You can see in your eyes you been through troubled times
D?ya play the guitar, son, or did you just run
The boys brought some beers yeah they left them out back
Ya stay for a while we can go down in style

It don't take much
To bring it all back
Yeah, you're all right
You lose it all, you bring it back again
You bring it back again
